# **The Libre Sample Pack**
##### *A free sample pack*
---
## **What is this?**

It is a free (as in freedom) and collaborative sample and preset pack, a bit more intended for Linux musicians, since all presets will be for Linux plugins.

### **Why?**

Because freedom is cool. Also because Linux music production is a bit bare in resources regards and it would be nice to change that.

### **By who?**

By Linux musicians, for Linux musicians.

### **How to download**

Open your nice, warm, and comfy teminal and type (Or copy paste)

## **To contribute**
You can contribute with samples or presets as long as they're yours and correctly organized.

---

## **Important**
Due to the nature of the project, I have little to no way of checking if all samples/presets are free to use, that's why we have the `trusted contributors` list: Anything uploaded by them is checked and double checked to be free to use.
